- Online EM has a reducing update factor and cannot respond to changes of the data points

- Clustering of hosts cannot be achieved naively online. Recluster after batch or enough changes? Maybe a better way to implement this.

- Not all points are represented by the clustering Poisson distributions. As a result a very small mass function value is computed for a lot of the points. Maybe combine an ierarchical approach too?

- What is the best way to flag anomalies?
